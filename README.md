# Simulations on The Game

The Game is a card game developed by Pandasaurus games. The goal is to play all cards out of a deck of cards which contains the numbers 2-99 uniquely. There are are four piles, two of which start at 1 and only numbers larger than the current to number can be played on it. The other two start at 100, and only numbers smaller than the top pile can be played on it. The on exeption is if you have a card with a difference of exactly ten of the current top card you can play it in the opposite direction of play. If you cannot make two plays in a turn you lose, and you can make as many plays as you desire. At the end of your turn you draw back to your starting hand size. 

The game can be played with up to five people, but as of current the simulations only simulate the one player game. Its notoriously difficult so the purpose of this project is to see how often it can be won.
